\title{Growth curves of pigs in a 3x3 factorial experiment}
\usage{data(dietox)}
\description{
  The \code{dietox} data frame has 861 rows and 7 columns.

  Data contains weight of slaughter pigs measured weekly for 12
  weeks. Data also contains the startweight (i.e. the weight at week
  1). The treatments are 3 different levels of Evit = vitamin E (dose:
  0, 100, 200 mg dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetat /kg feed) in combination
  with 3 different levels of Cu=copper (dose: 0, 35, 175 mg/kg feed) in
  the feed.  The cumulated feed intake is also recorded. The pigs are
  littermates.
