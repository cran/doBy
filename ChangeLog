	* Various bugs have been fixed

2006-09-18 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@agrsci.dk>

	* summaryBy has been reimplemented. 

	* summaryBy takes . as argument on both lhs and rhs in formula

	* summaryBy, splitBy takes drop=FALSE argument (just like split
	does)

	* transformBy function has been added

2006-02-05 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@agrsci.dk>

	* sampleBy modified allow for also 'systematic samples',
	e.g. every 5th row.

	* Function summaryBy modified to take . as lhs in formula and to
	take idvar = ~formula
